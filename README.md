##Lola

This directory contains the code for the program Lola, used in Sharon et al. for the assembly of Moleculo reads (Illumina TruSeq synthetic reads).
Important note: our results show that minimus2 from the AMOS package does a better job in assembling Moleculo long reads and it is also much faster and easy to 
use. We therefore recommend that you use Minimus2 and not Lola for this purpose. If you do choose to use Lola then here are some instructions.

### Running Lola

The process of assembling long reads with Lola consists of two stages:

1. Determining overlaps between the reads using the program overlap (https://github.com/CK7/overlap), and
2. Running Lola

For running overlap refer to the README file for the overlap project.
For running Lola use the following command:

```
$ <path-to-Lola-directory>/assemble.pl
```

Running this command without parameters will give you a description of the command line:

```
$ ./assemble.pl 

Usage: ./assemble.pl [-p <% identity threshold] <sequence-file> <connection-file1> [... <connection-filen>] <out-prefix>
```

Parameters are:
* **% identity threshold** - minimum % identity to be used by Lola for considering overlaps between reads. 
* **sequence file** - that's the file with reads you want to assemble 
* **connection-file** - that's the output file from the program overlap
* **out-prefix** - prefix for names of files that will be generated by Lola.

### Lola output
Output consists of the following files:

* **<out-prefix>.fna** - File with both assembled and unassembled reads. Reads that were used for the assembly and reads that were found to be contained in other reads are excluded from this file.
* **<out-prefix>.gff** - mapping of reads to assembled contigs and other reads (in case a read is contained within another read).
* **<out-prefix>.log** - a log file describing the assembly process. Can be used for debugging purposes.

### example

The directory example under this repository contains an example for how to run Lola. Modify path to Lola and overlap in the run file under this directory and 
then do

```
$ example/run
```

Check example/output for what the directory should look like after run finishes.
